# Loop-engineering notes

Design record for `/makeloop`'s generated prompts: the technique catalog, which were adopted
into the command, and what is deliberately deferred. It exists so the knowledge survives
across sessions and so contributors know *why* each block is shaped the way it is.

## Adopted (baseline — every generated loop)

- Five phases; three hearts (verify gate / state / stop); four-conditions test; maker≠checker;
  build order (prove manual → loop → schedule); cost per accepted change; Ralph Wiggum loop.
- **Re-anchor every iteration** — re-read GOAL + CRITERIA + RULES, not just state (drift fix).
- **Backpressure ladder** — order checks fastest→slowest, stop at first red.
- **Search before assuming**; **no fake done** (no stubs/TODOs as done, never weaken a check).
- **Feedback compression** — PASS = 1 line, FAIL = {expected/actual/fix}, no repeated failures.
- **Gate-will-be-gamed** (Goodhart) — holdouts, properties over self-written tests, spot-checks.

## Adopted (profile/directive-triggered optional blocks)

- Two-stage gate (pre/post, FREEZE on regression); observation-validity check; regression
  guard; budget (now incl. token+cost cap); extended stop taxonomy.
- **No-progress circuit breaker** — tool-call/plan hashing to detect a spin mechanically.
- **Cross-run learnings** — `.loop/learnings.md`, category-level prevention.
- **Escalation handoff** — context-rich handoff to a human inbox; escalate-as-success.
- **Scheduled-loop safety** — idempotency keys, external scheduler, tiered auto-approve,
  intent deny-list.
- **JSON done-ledger** — harder to casually fake than a markdown checklist.
- **LLM-as-judge hardening** — judge family ≠ maker family, coarse rubric, escalate
  low-confidence; property/metamorphic gates when example tests are the only oracle.
- **Maturity-adaptive** — DISCOVER judges greenfield → scaffolded → mature from the files;
  greenfield gets a **Bootstrap block** (iteration 0 scaffolds + writes failing acceptance
  tests, then drives red → green) instead of being told a loop is the wrong tool.
- **Session-context aware** — DISCOVER reads the live conversation (intent) as a primary goal
  signal and reconciles it with the git/files (reality); leads the in-flight-work goal with it.
- **Output in the user's language** — the generated prompt + summaries render in the
  conversation's language, not English by default; only machine-significant literals stay as-is.
- **Goal-fit guidance** — bias candidates toward loop-appropriate work (CI triage, dep bumps,
  lint-fix, flaky repro, suite-green); steer off loop-hostile goals (architecture, auth/
  payments, prod deploy, vague) → recommend a single guided prompt instead.
- **Independent completion check** (`/goal` pattern) — a separate model confirms the goal is
  met (not just the gate) when "done" can't be fully reduced to the gate.
- **Security tax** for unattended loops — security checks in the gate (secret scan / dep audit
  / SAST), human approval before irreversible actions, log hygiene, skill/connector source
  audit, periodic permission re-audit.
- **Ready-to-paste launch line** — Step 6 leads with the exact command the user runs, in
  file-reference form (`/loop <saved file> の手順に従って…`) so the loop re-reads its contract
  each iteration instead of pasting the whole prompt; saved files use a descriptive slug
  (`.loop/<slug>.md`) so multiple loops don't clobber each other.
- **Loop kind: closed vs open** — DISCOVER classifies closed (drive-to-done: goal + verify
  gate + FINAL) vs open (watch/react: WATCH TARGET + TRIGGER CONDITION + observe→evaluate→
  notify/act + dedup/cursor, no FINAL). Decided by goal verb + the decisive test ("can a
  SUCCESS CRITERION become permanently true and END the loop?"); default closed on ambiguity
  (open→runs-forever is the costlier misclassification). The wrong-tool warning is suppressed
  for open watchers. Deliberately NOT added: a trigger sub-taxonomy (heartbeat/cron/hook) and
  a second full skeleton — one skeleton, kind-conditional middle; shared blocks stay DRY.

## Adopted — Round 1 community harvest (2026-06-24)

Surfaced by the sources-harvest loop and wired in after review:
- **Iteration economics / wide-not-deep** — size the cap from diminishing returns (gain ≈50%
  round 1, ≈25% round 2; ~5-6 cap); past the ceiling, re-touching validated code regresses;
  when quality plateaus add more verifier *types*, not more iterations.
- **Re-verify the diff, not the world** — iter 1 checks all; later iters re-check only the
  changed surface.
- **Dual-verifier AND-gate** — pair an LLM-judge with a deterministic assertion; done only if
  both pass; route the failing check into the retry.
- **Failure-class retry** — rate-limit→backoff; validation→rewrite-from-feedback; 5xx→retry
  then move on; tool-unavailable→pause+notify.
- **UI drive-and-capture** — for UI/web, verify by exercising the feature + capturing a
  screenshot/GIF as proof-of-use (and PR evidence).
Held in the local catalog (not wired — too niche/fleet for the generic generator): formal-spec
(TLA+) as driver, self-instrumentation feedback, opportunity-object ranker, behavioral
circuit breaker [D], toxic-flow simulation [D].

Round 2 (confirmation, decay 11→5, harvest loop closed at near-saturation) — wired 2:
- **Shrink-the-unit on repeat failure** — retry → decompose to the smallest failing fragment →
  escalate (a middle gear between blind retry and abort).
- **Repo-grounded rubric + anti-cheat/blast-radius axes** — the LLM-judge reads the repo before
  scoring and carries an explicit anti-cheating axis (test-weakening / mass-rename / dep-churn)
  and a blast-radius axis.
Held in catalog: pre-code ambiguity gate (restates existing goal/criteria confirmation),
weighted-drift→auto-retrospective [thin], oracle-gap adaptive test hardening [thin/eval-rig].

## Self-improvement system (auto-strengthening — LIVE via the every-2-days cron)

makeloop can strengthen itself by harvesting community knowledge and wiring what earns its
weight. The machinery (built and running unattended every 2 days):
- **Golden eval** (`eval/scenarios.md`) — the objective quality gate ("still good", beyond the
  lint's "not broken"): regenerate loops for fixed scenarios, check the output's properties.
- **Governance contract** (`SELF-IMPROVEMENT.md`, the fixed trust anchor) — autonomy tiers
  (0 data / 1 additive-auto / 2 behavior-human-GO / 3 contract-human-only), the **monotonicity
  invariant** (auto-edits may only add/strengthen, never weaken a gate), the **fit-critic
  rubric** (earns-weight, default-reject), the **prune mandate** (strengthen+prune homeostasis),
  and what stays read-only/out-of-loop.
- **Self-improve open loop** (`.loop/self-improve.md`, local) — harvest → dedup → fit-critic →
  propose diff → eval-gate → Tier1 auto-apply / Tier2 escalate / Tier3 never → prune every 3
  cycles. Run-indefinitely. The contract + eval are read-only anchors it cannot edit.
- **Deterministic gate** (`.githooks/gate.sh`) — the code (not prose) that makes Tier 1 real
  automation: mechanically checks guarded phrases intact, no gate-bypass clause added, anchor
  untouched, JSON/structure/leak/eval. Behind the anchor (deny + pre-commit + chmod). Red-team
  hardened (C1 firewall, C2 behavioral monotonicity, C3 out-of-band enforcement, H1 exfil
  allow-list, H2 critic independence, M1 fresh-context apply, M2 guarded-phrase integrity).
- **H1/H2 now code-enforced (toward zero-human Tier 1):** H1 — `.claude/settings.json` denies
  the outbound MCP tools (Gmail/Drive/Calendar) + secret-read globs (`.env`/`*credential*`/
  `id_rsa*`); WebFetch is GET-only and gate.sh blocks committing secrets to public files. H2 —
  the fit-critic runs as a 3-different-model panel (one a dedicated injection-hunter), with
  corroboration counted by independent operator-trusted domains, not text agreement. Editing the
  anchor to add the H1 deny required an explicit human chmod (the auto-mode classifier blocked
  the agent from un-protecting it on a generic "GO" — the design working as intended).

## Automation (the every-2-days self-improvement cron)

The self-improvement loop runs unattended via local cron every 2 days → wrapper
(`.loop/self-improve-run.sh`) → one headless `claude` cycle → Tier-1 auto-apply on
`gate.sh` PASS. Operator runbook (pause/resume/monitor/install, first-watched-run, undo) is in
[`AUTOMATION.md`](AUTOMATION.md). Pause = `touch .loop/PAUSED`; log = `.loop/cron.log`; bot
commits authored `makeloop-selfimprove`. Fresh clones ship PAUSED; enable with `rm .loop/PAUSED`
after one watched run.

## Self-improvement run history

A public trail of what the self-improvement loop changed, when, and in which commit — the companion
to `git log --author=makeloop-selfimprove` (richer per-commit detail) and `.loop/cron.log` (local
raw log, gitignored). The loop appends ONE line here after any run that changed a public file.
**Allowed fields only (H1): date, commit SHA, Tier, changed public files, change class, gate result,
round/prune — NEVER source URLs, authors, fetched text, secrets, or `.local/` contents.**

Format: `- <date> <SHA> [Tier-N] <changed public files> — <change class> · gate:PASS · <round|prune|manual>`

Automated runs (`makeloop-selfimprove`): none yet — near-saturation, silent archives so far.

## Dogfood runs (does the generator earn its weight?)

Real runs of makeloop-*generated* loops, measured for accept + cost — the public, sanitized
"examples-as-benchmark" trail (raw ledger is local). Closed-loop metric = cost proxy per accepted
change; cost proxy falls back tokens → iterations → wall-clock when tokens aren't available.

| run | request | kind | profile | gate | iters | outcome |
|-----|---------|------|---------|------|-------|---------|
| df-001 | CSV→JSON CLI, tests green | closed | greenfield/empty (py) | `pytest -q` | 2 | accepted |

- df-001: the **Bootstrap block fired correctly** — iteration 0 scaffolded `convert.py` + acceptance
  tests and confirmed RED, iteration 1 drove green; stdlib `csv.DictReader` satisfied all four
  criteria in one pass. cost/accepted = 2 iterations. (Greenfield-closed path validated end-to-end.)

First data point — too few to conclude. Accumulate ~5-10 before judging the generator or wiring
anything new; recurring failure classes graduate to golden-eval scenarios or docs.

## Deferred (fleet / multi-loop orchestration — out of scope for the single-loop generator)

makeloop today generates **one** loop. The biggest unexplored area is fleet-level: multiple
cooperating loops that compound. Candidate future "fleet mode":

- Shared **signals** + global append-only work log as the cross-loop bus.
- Four trigger types (heartbeat / cron / hook / goal) instead of just self-paced/interval.
- Worktree-per-loop isolation + single-writer file ownership; sub-agent depth cap.
- Standing read-only **reviewer loop** that pre-filters the human queue; risk-sorted PR triage.
- Structured spans / deterministic replay (run_id) / independent pre-action audit receipt.
- Shadow mode → competence-based autonomy promotion (HITL → HOTL → autonomous) with
  numeric promotion thresholds and demotion triggers.
- WIP limit tied to human review capacity (3–5 concurrent).
